#### Understanding of errors: 
1) C0114/C0ll6: Missing module docstring/function docstring <br/>
  This tells that the docstring is not specified for the modules or functions. The docstring is like a comment or some text description that is ingored by compiler but helps other people to understand the 
  purpose of module/function docstring. It is a good practice to write docstrings.
2) C0103: Variable does not confirm to snake_case naming sty;e<br/>
  This error tells that the declared vairable is not according to snake_case naming convention.
3) W0621: Redifining name from outerscope <br/>
  This error tells that the local variable name is same as that of one of global variable. This makes the local scope to use local version of the variable while hiding the global version
  of the variable.
  4) C0321: More than one statment on a single line<br/>
    This tells that multiple statements are written in the same line. This is not a good practice as the code will be more readable when single statement is there in a line.
  5) R1705: Unneccessary else after return statement<br/>
    This is caused when an else statement is written after a "return" statement which is not executed anyhow.
  6) W0611: Unused imports
    This is caused when there are any modules or packages that are imported but not used.
   7) C0303: Trailing whitespace at the end of a line
   This is caused when there is emtpy space at the end of line and before a new line.This space is unneccessary.
